# Module: progress-photos

Developer change log for the **progress-photos** module. Update every PR.

## Status
- [x] Read MODULE_CONTRACT.md + CONTRIBUTING.md
- [x] Built from the Power Apps "Progress Photos" app (drawing-register used as the
      file-upload reference)
- [x] CRUD implemented (upload / edit / view / list / delete)
- [x] Project-scoped via `pd_project`; `created_by` + `project_id` stamped
- [x] `Fmt.esc()` on all user text injected into HTML
- [x] `enabled: true` set in `assets/js/config.js`
- [ ] PR opened into `main`
- [x] **View PPRs** — PPR Presentations Database + slides viewer/editor + offline export

## PPR Presentations built (2026-07-17)

Replaces the Power Apps **PPR PRESENTATIONS DATABASE** and **EDIT PROGRESS PHOTO
SLIDES** screens. A PPR is one monthly Project Performance Review presentation; each
slide is a **before/after pair** at one location — last month's photo beside this
month's — tagged Trade / Works / Location with an optional Key Plan overlay.

- **Two top-level screens** (the app's home: *View Photos* / *View PPRs*) as a
  `Photos | PPRs` switch in the topbar, persisted in `localStorage['pp_screen']`. Both
  share one project selector: `ProgressPhotos.onProject(fn)` publishes the current
  project and `ProgressPhotos.trades()` shares the trade vocabulary, so the two screens
  never disagree.
- **Database screen:** PPR Date · Description · No. of Slides, with **PPR date start/end
  filters** and a **Preview pane** showing numbered slide thumbnails (the app's exact
  "No slides to show." wording when a PPR is empty). Clicking a thumbnail jumps straight
  to that slide.
- **Slides screen:** PPR Project / PPR Meeting Date / PPR Description / `‹ n › of N`
  header, Trade / Works / Location / Key Plan meta, and the two photos side by side with
  each one's capture date and italic caption. **Key Plan toggles an overlay on both
  photos**, matching the app's expand/collapse control.
- **Slide photos are picked from the Photos Database, never re-uploaded** (owner's call).
  `before_photo_id` / `after_photo_id` reference `progress_photos`; picking a photo
  **pre-fills the slide's trade/works/location/caption** from that photo, since the
  library already carries them. Key plans are the one exception — they're not progress
  photos, so they upload to `<project>/keyplans/` in the same bucket.
- **`on delete set null`, deliberately:** deleting a photo must not silently delete the
  PPR slide citing it. The slide survives with an empty frame so a planner sees what went
  missing and re-picks.

### Download = a self-contained offline copy (owner's requirement)
The app owner's brief: *"an offline view of that PPR Date in case the photos database
loads slowly due to connectivity or the sheer amount of photos."* So Download does **not**
produce a deck — it writes a **standalone `.html`** with every image inlined as a
downscaled data URI (max 1600px, JPEG q0.82), inline CSS, **no scripts and no external
references at all**. It opens instantly with no network and no dependency on Supabase
being reachable, and prints one slide per page.
- Photos are fetched to a **blob first**, then drawn via an object URL — a signed
  Supabase URL drawn straight into a canvas would be **cross-origin and taint it**, making
  `toDataURL()` throw. The blob round-trip keeps the canvas same-origin. Don't "simplify"
  this to `img.src = signedUrl`.
- Downscaling is not cosmetic: full-resolution site photos would make the file enormous
  and slow to open — the opposite of the point.

## Verified (2026-07-17)
Harness-verified against a mutable in-memory store (stubbed `AppAuth`/`PDb`/Supabase +
storage; deleted after use). Confirmed: PPR list newest-first (and a newly created PPR
sorts to the top); date-range filter; preview thumbnails + "No slides to show."; slides
header/meta reproducing the app's fields exactly; capture dates ("June 8, 2026" /
"June 25, 2026") and italic captions; key plan overlaying **both** photos and absent when
a slide has none; slide nav with end-disabled arrows; PPR + slide CRUD incl. blank-date
refusal, tag pre-fill on photo pick, and cascade delete; topbar tools following the inner
screen; Photos screen unaffected by the two-screen restructure; dark mode on all PPR
surfaces (`#2B2C2B`, light text); two-column split at 1440px with no horizontal overflow.

**The offline export was verified as a real artifact, not just by structure:** the
generated file was captured, written into a sandboxed iframe with no network, and
rendered — **5/5 images decoded, 0 broken, key plan present, brand-red header, two-column
pairs, 0 external references**.

⚠️ **Testing note for whoever tests this next:** two false alarms came from the *harness*,
not the module. (1) Stubbing `URL.createObjectURL` globally breaks `blobToImage`, so every
image "fails to embed" — scope the stub to the `text/html` blob only. (2) A no-op
`order()` stub makes ordering assertions meaningless; the stub now really sorts.

## Pending
- Live click-through against a real login, the real bucket, and real photo sizes — the
  export's file size and embed time have only been measured against small fixtures.

## Photos Database built (2026-07-17)

Replaces the Power Apps **Progress Photos | Photos Database** screen.

- **The row is the Power Apps row:** PHOTO · DESCRIPTION · TRADE · WORKS · LOCATION ·
  CAPTURE DATE, with per-row **download** + **view full size**, plus edit/delete for
  planner+.
- **List View / Gallery View toggle** (the app's bottom-right switch), persisted per
  project in `localStorage` (`pp_view_<pid>`). List = a compact grid with thumbnails;
  Gallery = large photo cards with the detail table beneath, matching the app's layout.
- **Filters mirror the app's**: capture start, capture end, Trade, Works, Location —
  plus a free-text search the original lacked. Trade/Works/Location options are derived
  from the project's own rows (no empty dropdowns), and a "Clear filters" button resets.
- **List View groups by Trade** (collapsible, with counts, persisted in
  `pp_collapsed_<pid>`). The Power Apps grouped by *project* because its selector was
  "My Projects" (multi-project); this module is project-scoped by contract (§6), so the
  project is the topbar selector and Trade is the useful grouping.
- **Lightbox** = the app's fullscreen expand: click any thumbnail/photo, navigate with
  ← / → or the on-screen arrows, Esc closes, caption shows trade · works · location ·
  date and an N/M counter.
- **Batch upload:** one modal takes many files against one set of shared fields
  (description/date/trade/works/location) and writes a row per file, then you edit any
  individual photo afterwards. Progress is reported per file; a failure on one file
  doesn't abort the batch.
- **Shell:** sidebar-less topbar (matches Project Schedule / Cash Flow / Drawing
  Register) — back button, title, project selector, view tabs, tools beside the profile.

## Trade / Works vocabulary
`TRADES` mirrors the **WPM (procurement) trade list** (Site Works, Civil, Structural,
Architectural, Mechanical, Electrical and Auxiliary, Plumbing and Sanitary, Fire
Protection, General Requirements) so photos, work packages and Cash Flow's cash-out all
group by the same names. **Works** is free text with a datalist of the values already
used on the project (the app's Works list is project-specific — e.g. "Temporary
Facilities" — so a fixed enum would fight real usage). Revisit if a canonical Works
list is issued.

## Storage
Private **`progress-photos`** bucket (already created by
`migrations/2026-06-18-storage-buckets.sql`). Path = `<project_id>/<ts>_<rand>_<safe
name>`; the table stores the path in `photo_url`, never a public URL. Previews use
**batch-signed URLs** — one `createSignedUrls(paths, 3600)` per load rather than one
signing round-trip per row — cached in `urlCache` and refreshed on reload.

## DB
- **Run migration `migrations/2026-07-17-progress-photos.sql`** — adds `trade`, `works`,
  `sort_order` to `progress_photos` + a `(project_id, taken_at desc)` index. Idempotent;
  folded into `supabase-schema.sql`. **The module shows blank Trade/Works until it runs.**
- `description` / `location` / `photo_url` / `taken_at` (capture date) already existed on
  the starter table. `tags` is unused so far.

## Notes / decisions
- `UI.modal()` takes no width and does **not** wire close buttons, so the module has a
  local `openModal(html, width)` helper that sets `max-width` and wires `[data-close]`
  rather than editing the shared `ui.js` (contract §1 forbids shared edits). Worth
  promoting into `ui.js` by the app owner if other modules want it.

## Verified (2026-07-17)
Harness-verified against a mutable in-memory store (stubbed `AppAuth`/`PDb`/Supabase +
storage, no real credentials or backend touched; deleted after use). Confirmed: trade
grouping + collapse/expand; every filter (trade → 3/5, date-from → 2/5, search → 1/5,
clear → 5/5); gallery toggle (5 cards); lightbox open/next/close with correct captions
and 1/5 counter; edit round-trip persists to the row; delete removes it; batch upload of
2 files → 2 rows + new trade group + refreshed filter options; dark mode (grid bg
`#2B2C2B`, light text — tokens, no hard-coded white); modal width + `[data-close]`
wiring; no console errors.

**Screenshots were not possible** — this environment's compositor is stalled
(`visibilityState` stays `hidden`, `computer{screenshot}` times out), the same condition
noted in earlier prompts. Verification was done via DOM/computed values instead. Photo
`<img>` decode was confirmed directly (`naturalWidth` 400 on both thumbnails and the
lightbox), so the `loading="lazy"` thumbnails are proven to load.

## Pending
- **View PPRs** (the app's other screen) — not built yet.
- Live click-through against a real login + the real `progress-photos` bucket.
