# Planners Dashboard — Main App Change Log

This file tracks the **main app** (shell) work, maintained by the Planning team
owner. Each module keeps its own `modules/<key>/CLAUDE.md`. One entry per prompt.

---

## 👋 START HERE if you are building a module (read before writing code)

If you are a developer (or a developer's Claude) assigned ONE module, do this:

1. **Read [`MODULE_CONTRACT.md`](MODULE_CONTRACT.md)** — the rules: folder layout,
   required HTML boilerplate, the shared APIs you must use (`AppAuth`, `PDb`,
   `Fmt`, `UI`), database rules, and the definition of done. This is mandatory.
2. **Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — git workflow: work on branch
   `module/<your-key>`, edit ONLY your `modules/<your-key>/` folder, PR to `main`.
3. **Copy a reference module** as your starting point:
   - `modules/risk-register/` — plain CRUD + filters + KPIs + a derived field.
   - `modules/drawing-register/` — same, PLUS the **file-upload** pattern
     (private Supabase Storage bucket + signed-URL viewing).
   - `modules/_template/` — the minimal skeleton.
4. **Do NOT edit** shared files (`assets/**`, other modules, the HTML shell).
   The only shared edits allowed: add YOUR table to `supabase-schema.sql`, and
   flip YOUR module's `enabled: true` in `assets/js/config.js`.
5. **Keep `modules/<your-key>/CLAUDE.md` updated** each PR (what you built, any
   columns/buckets you added).

Supabase URL + anon key are already in `assets/js/config.js`. Ask the app owner
for a test login. The shell (login, roles, project picker context via the
`pd_project` sessionStorage key, branding) is already done — just build your
module's screens against the shared APIs.

## Project summary
Consolidated dashboard for construction Planning Engineers (Megawide). Replaces
an existing Power Apps tool. Seven Phase-1 modules, each built by a separate
developer, plug into one shared shell.

**Architecture decisions (locked 2026-06-18):**
- Stack: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, GitHub Pages hosting
- Backend: one shared **new** Supabase project (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
- Integration: shared shell + documented contract (`MODULE_CONTRACT.md`), single repo
- Auth: shared Supabase Auth + roles across all modules
  (`super_admin > admin > planner > user > viewer`)

**Reference:** Procurement WPM app —
`C:\Users\fmlozano\...\Procurement Dashboard\wpm\CLAUDE.md`
(same vanilla + Supabase + GitHub Pages pattern; Phase 2 will integrate with it).

## Key files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `assets/js/config.js` | Supabase creds + `MODULES` registry (flip `enabled` per module) |
| `assets/js/auth.js` | `AppAuth` — login, roles, `requireLogin/requireRole/requireAdmin` |
| `assets/js/db.js` | `PDb` (projects/users) + `Fmt` formatters |
| `assets/js/ui.js` | `UI` — toasts, user bar, modal |
| `assets/css/dashboard.css` | Global styles + design tokens (`--pd-*`) |
| `supabase-schema.sql` | All shared + module tables, RLS, bootstrap notes |
| `MODULE_CONTRACT.md` | Rules every module developer must follow |

## Roles
| Role | Notes |
|---|---|
| `super_admin` | full control, only role that can set super_admin |
| `admin` | manage users/projects, all modules |
| `planner` | auto-approve writer, all projects |
| `user` | assigned projects only |
| `viewer` | read-only |

`status`: `pending` → `approved`/`rejected`. New sign-ups land in `pending`.

## Changelog

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 1: Foundation scaffold
- Initial project structure, shared shell, and developer contract.
- Added: `index.html` (login), `register.html`, `pending.html`, `dashboard.html`
  (module launcher driven by `APP_CONFIG.MODULES`).
- Added shared JS: `config.js`, `auth.js` (AppAuth), `db.js` (PDb + Fmt),
  `ui.js` (UI). Added global `dashboard.css` with design tokens.
- Added `supabase-schema.sql`: `projects`, `users`, starter table per Phase-1
  module, `is_admin()/is_approved()` helpers, and RLS policies (read-all-approved,
  write-own-or-admin) applied to every module table.
- Added `MODULE_CONTRACT.md` (folder layout, required boilerplate, shared APIs,
  DB rules, git branch-per-module + PR workflow, definition of done).
- Added `modules/_template/` (full working CRUD example) and placeholder
  `index.html` + `CLAUDE.md` for all 7 module folders.
- Added `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 2: Admin screen + multi-dev git workflow
- Added `admin.html`: Users tab (approve/reject, inline role change with
  super_admin guard, per-user project assignment modal) + Projects tab
  (create/edit/archive via modal). Admin-gated by `AppAuth.requireAdmin`.
- Multi-developer collaboration handling:
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — per-developer git author identity, branch-per-module,
    rebase-before-PR, PR-into-main workflow. Recommends individual GitHub
    collaborator accounts over a shared login.
  - `.github/CODEOWNERS` — shared files → app owner, module folders → dev
    (placeholders to fill once devs assigned).
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md` — contract checklist.
  - `ONBOARDING.md` — copy/paste per-developer message + assignment tracker.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 3: Supabase wiring + Risk Register reference module
- Supabase project connected: URL `https://bgupuqnkqhixpuctyder.supabase.co`
  set in `config.js`. **anon key still pending** (user to paste; service_role
  key they shared was flagged for rotation — must NEVER be in client code).
- Schema already run by user in Supabase SQL editor. GitHub Pages enabled
  (deploy from `main`).
- Built **Risk Register** as the end-to-end reference module
  (`modules/risk-register/`): list view with filters + KPIs, 5×5 risk matrix,
  add/edit modal with app-computed `rating = likelihood × impact`, delete.
  Demonstrates every contract pattern (auth, pd_project, created_by, Fmt.esc).
- Flipped `risk-register` to `enabled: true` in `config.js`.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 4: Per-project RLS + Drawing Register reference module
- **anon key** pasted into `config.js` (verified role=anon). App can now reach DB.
- **Per-project access enforced at the DB level:** added `can_access_project()`
  helper; rewrote `projects` + all module-table RLS so admins see everything and
  planner/user/viewer only see projects in their `users.projects` array.
  Migration: `migrations/2026-06-18-project-access-rls.sql` (also folded into
  `supabase-schema.sql`). **User must run this migration in Supabase.**
- Built **Drawing Register** (`modules/drawing-register/`) as the file-upload
  reference module: status/discipline/search filters, revision + status pills,
  add/edit modal with file upload to a **private** Storage bucket, view via
  short-lived signed URL, delete (removes object + row). Enabled in `config.js`.
- Storage setup migration `migrations/2026-06-18-storage-buckets.sql` creates
  private buckets (`drawing-register`, `progress-photos`, `material-submittal`)
  + policies. **User must run this migration too.**

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 5: Live verification
- GitHub Pages live at `https://pmodepartment.github.io/planning-app/`; login
  page + deployed `config.js` (correct URL + anon key) confirmed serving.
- **Bug found via live REST probe:** all tables returned `42501 permission
  denied` for `anon`/`authenticated` — table GRANTs were missing (separate layer
  from RLS). Fix: `migrations/2026-06-18-grants.sql` (grant DML to authenticated
  + default privileges for future module tables); folded into `supabase-schema.sql`.
  **User must run this migration.**

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 6: Fix index↔dashboard redirect loop
- Verified data layer live: authed REST queries now return 200 (grants fix
  confirmed), RLS returns [] for unapproved users, anon blocked.
- **Bug:** infinite redirect loop index.html ↔ dashboard.html for users whose
  `auth.users` account has no `users` profile row (the promote UPDATE matched 0
  rows because the row never existed). `requireLogin` sent profile-less sessions
  back to index.html, which bounces sessions to dashboard → loop.
- **Fix (auth.js):** added `ensureProfile()` self-heal — a sessioned user with
  no profile row gets a `pending` row created, then goes to pending.html (never
  back to index.html). Hard stop signs out if profile truly can't be created.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 7: Brand alignment (Brandbook 2026)
- Adapted `assets/css/dashboard.css` design tokens to the Megawide Brandbook:
  Red `#EE3124`, Dark Red `#C42127`, Dark Gray `#2B2C2B` (dark surfaces), Black
  `#231F20` (text), Construction Gray `#DCDBDB` (lines), bg `#F4F4F4`.
- Typeface: Gotham (primary, licensed/not bundled) → **Montserrat** web fallback
  via Google Fonts `@import` (same convention as the Procurement WPM app). New
  `--pd-font` token; body + headings use it.
- Sidebar/topbar-dark and toast now use brand Dark Gray; brand wordmark heavier
  (800). Status colors kept distinct from brand red so errors ≠ brand.
- Single source of truth: all pages/modules inherit branding from dashboard.css;
  no per-page changes needed. If a Gotham webfont license is obtained, self-host
  it and it's picked up automatically (first in the font stack).

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 9: Logo + favicon across all pages
- Added brand assets in `assets/img/`: `favicon.png` (red Megawide "M" block
  icon), `logo-white.png` (white wordmark, cropped to content), `icon.png`
  (apple-touch). Mirrors the Procurement WPM convention.
- Favicon + apple-touch link injected into every page's `<head>` (root + all
  module pages, with correct `../../` prefix).
- Sidebar `.pd-brand` now leads with the white wordmark (`.pd-brand-logo`) and
  shows the page label as a caption; auth pages show the red mark
  (`.pd-auth-mark`). CSS added to `dashboard.css`.
- `MODULE_CONTRACT.md` boilerplate updated so new modules include favicon + logo.
  Reference modules + `_template` already updated, so future modules inherit it.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 10: Dashboard UX polish (PowerApps-inspired)
- Topbar: title "Modules" → **"Project Management Portal"** with the red
  Megawide "M" mark (`.pd-topbar-mark`) beside it; user-bar pushed right.
- **Collapsible sidebar:** `UI.initShell()` (ui.js) auto-injects a hamburger
  toggle into the topbar of every shell page; desktop collapses sidebar to zero
  width (persisted in localStorage `pd_sidebar_collapsed`), mobile slides it in.
- Logo sizing optimized (sidebar wordmark 150px; topbar mark 30px).
- **Module cards redesigned** for the big white space: fixed 4-col grid
  (→3/2/1 responsive) so 7 cards distribute as 4+3; larger tiles with
  red-tinted icon squares, brand-red hover accent strip, clearer CTA/badge.
- Added welcome header ("Welcome, <first name>") above the grid.
- New tokens `--pd-red-light` / `--pd-red-mid`.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 11: Dark mode (shared, automatic)
- Followed the Procurement app pattern: token remap on `html.pd-dark`, applied
  before paint to avoid FOUC, persisted in localStorage `pd_theme`, with
  `color-scheme: dark` for native controls.
- New `assets/js/theme.js` (loaded in every page's `<head>`): applies saved/
  system theme immediately + auto-injects a 🌙/☀️ toggle into the top bar
  (shell pages) or as a floating round button (auth pages). Zero work for devs.
- `dashboard.css`: converted hard-coded `#fff`/`#fafbfc`/`#fbfbfb` component
  backgrounds to tokens so they adapt; added the `html.pd-dark` override block
  (bg #1C1C1C, card #2B2C2B, sidebar #161717, light text/borders) + toggle btn
  styles.
- `MODULE_CONTRACT.md`: boilerplate now includes `theme.js`; added a "dark mode
  is automatic — use tokens, never hard-code #fff/#000" rule. Reference modules
  + `_template` already wired via injection, so new modules inherit dark mode.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 12: Sidebar default-collapsed, PRC-style logo, profile menu, split name, forgot-password
- Sidebar now **collapsed by default** on entry (clean look); only an explicit
  expand (localStorage `pd_sidebar_collapsed='0'`) keeps it open.
- Sidebar brand restyled to match PRC-App: white wordmark fills width
  (left-aligned), red uppercase app label, divider beneath.
- **Profile avatar menu** (PRC-style): `UI.renderUserBar` now renders a round
  initials avatar; click → dropdown with name, role, and **Sign out**. Outside-
  click closes. Token-based (dark-mode ready).
- `register.html`: Full name split into **First name / Last name** (joined into
  `users.name`).
- New **forgot-password.html** (shared styles + theme.js) using
  `resetPasswordForEmail` with a redirect back to `index.html`; linked from the
  login page ("Forgot password?").

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 13: Add 4 Phase-2 modules to the dashboard
- Registered 4 new modules in `config.js` (enabled:false → "In development"
  cards): `project-schedule` (Project Schedule, Cost Loading & S-Curve),
  `resource-loading`, `productivity-rates`, `cash-flow`.
- Created each module folder with a branded placeholder `index.html` +
  onboarding `CLAUDE.md` (same pattern as Phase-1 placeholders).
- Added starter tables to `supabase-schema.sql` + the RLS array; new migration
  `migrations/2026-06-18-phase2-modules.sql` (tables + grants + per-project RLS).
  **User must run this migration in Supabase.**
- Updated ONBOARDING.md assignment tracker.

- **Still TODO (next prompts):** run the migrations in Supabase (incl. phase2);
  create the
  buckets via the migration; branch protection on `main`; live end-to-end test;
  remaining modules (issues-lessons, contracts-claims, stakeholder-map,
  material-submittal, progress-photos) — or hand to developers.
