# Planners Dashboard — Main App Change Log

This file tracks the **main app** (shell) work, maintained by the Planning team
owner. Each module keeps its own `modules/<key>/CLAUDE.md`. One entry per prompt.

---

## 👋 START HERE if you are building a module (read before writing code)

If you are a developer (or a developer's Claude) assigned ONE module, do this:

1. **Read [`MODULE_CONTRACT.md`](MODULE_CONTRACT.md)** — the rules: folder layout,
   required HTML boilerplate, the shared APIs you must use (`AppAuth`, `PDb`,
   `Fmt`, `UI`), database rules, and the definition of done. This is mandatory.
2. **Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — git workflow: work on branch
   `module/<your-key>`, edit ONLY your `modules/<your-key>/` folder, PR to `main`.
3. **Copy a reference module** as your starting point:
   - `modules/risk-register/` — plain CRUD + filters + KPIs + a derived field.
   - `modules/drawing-register/` — same, PLUS the **file-upload** pattern
     (private Supabase Storage bucket + signed-URL viewing).
   - `modules/_template/` — the minimal skeleton.
4. **Do NOT edit** shared files (`assets/**`, other modules, the HTML shell).
   The only shared edits allowed: add YOUR table to `supabase-schema.sql`, and
   flip YOUR module's `enabled: true` in `assets/js/config.js`.
5. **Keep `modules/<your-key>/CLAUDE.md` updated** each PR (what you built, any
   columns/buckets you added).

Supabase URL + anon key are already in `assets/js/config.js`. Ask the app owner
for a test login. The shell (login, roles, project picker context via the
`pd_project` sessionStorage key, branding) is already done — just build your
module's screens against the shared APIs.

## Project summary
Consolidated dashboard for construction Planning Engineers (Megawide). Replaces
an existing Power Apps tool. Seven Phase-1 modules, each built by a separate
developer, plug into one shared shell.

**Architecture decisions (locked 2026-06-18):**
- Stack: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no build step, GitHub Pages hosting
- Backend: one shared **new** Supabase project (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
- Integration: shared shell + documented contract (`MODULE_CONTRACT.md`), single repo
- Auth: shared Supabase Auth + roles across all modules
  (`super_admin > admin > planner > user > viewer`)

**Reference:** Procurement WPM app —
`C:\Users\fmlozano\...\Procurement Dashboard\wpm\CLAUDE.md`
(same vanilla + Supabase + GitHub Pages pattern; Phase 2 will integrate with it).

## Key files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `assets/js/config.js` | Supabase creds + `MODULES` registry (flip `enabled` per module; `icon` = icon **name**) |
| `assets/js/auth.js` | `AppAuth` — login, roles, `requireLogin/requireRole/requireAdmin`. Login lands on `projects.html` |
| `assets/js/db.js` | `PDb` (projects/users/**workspaces**) + `Fmt` formatters |
| `assets/js/ui.js` | `UI` — toasts, avatar/user menu, modal, collapsible sidebar (`initShell`) |
| `assets/js/icons.js` | `Icons.svg(name,size)` + `data-ico` auto-hydration — the pro line-icon set (replaces emoji) |
| `assets/js/theme.js` | Dark mode (`html.pd-dark`), sun/moon toggle, FOUC guard |
| `assets/css/dashboard.css` | Global styles + design tokens (`--pd-*`) |
| `projects.html` | **Project Selector** (entry point): Workspace→Program→Project tree + project list |
| `dashboard.html` | **Project Home** for the selected project (Project/Program/Workspace tabs + module grid) |
| `admin.html` | User approval/roles/project-assignment + project & workspace management |
| `supabase-schema.sql` / `supabase-setup.sql` | All shared + module tables, RLS, grants, helpers, bootstrap |
| `MODULE_CONTRACT.md` | Rules every module developer must follow |

## Roles
| Role | Notes |
|---|---|
| `super_admin` | full control, only role that can set super_admin |
| `admin` | manage users/projects, all modules |
| `planner` | auto-approve writer, all projects |
| `user` | assigned projects only |
| `viewer` | read-only |

`status`: `pending` → `approved`/`rejected`. New sign-ups land in `pending`.

## Changelog

### 2026-06-30 — Catch-up (Desktop): Project Schedule build + design direction
Recorded here to sync the Desktop CLAUDE.md with the Teams ("Planners App
Project") work that has since landed on `main`.

- **`project-schedule` module built** (Primavera Cloud reference, not a module
  copy) and `enabled`. Two-tab layout: **Schedule** (WBS / Activity ID / Name /
  Type / Status / Planned & Actual Start-Finish / Duration / % Complete progress
  bar / Responsible Party) and **Cost Loading** (Planned/Actual cost, Earned
  Value, Cost Variance, CPI, % Complete + TOTALS). KPI cards (Overall % Complete,
  Completed, In Progress, Planned/Actual Cost, CPI, SPI). Filters + add/edit
  modal. Schema add: `migrations/2026-06-30-project-schedule-columns.sql`
  (`actual_start/finish`, `activity_type`, `status`, `responsible_party`).
  **No Gantt chart yet** — see direction below.

- **NEW DESIGN DIRECTION (2026-06-30):** mirror the **Procurement (WPM)** app —
  a **Portfolio Overview** and a **Project View**. **Focus the Project View
  first.** For **Project Schedule**, add an **Oracle Primavera Cloud (OPC)-style
  Gantt**: an **Activities grid on the left** (the existing Schedule table) with
  a **time-scaled Gantt bar chart on the right** (planned vs actual bars, today
  line, WBS grouping, zoom by day/week/month). The Gantt lives **inside the
  `project-schedule` module**, as a third view/tab alongside Schedule and Cost
  Loading. (Sample of the OPC activities + Gantt view to be provided by owner.)
- De-emoji / professional UI pass is complete (icons.js); the codebase contains
  no emoji. Any emoji still seen in the browser = stale GitHub Pages cache
  (hard-refresh) rather than source.

### 2026-06-30 — Prompt 20: Professional UI pass (de-emoji, SVG icon set)
- Replaced playful emoji throughout the app with a **professional monochrome
  line-icon set**. New `assets/js/icons.js` (`Icons.svg(name,size)` + `data-ico`
  auto-hydration); dependency-free, brand-colored via `currentColor`.
- `config.js` module `icon` values now icon **names** (camera, clipboard,
  contract, risk, compass, ruler, box, calendar, trendingUp, users, barChart, cash).
- Updated shell + pages to use icons: `dashboard.html` (sidebar nav, project
  switcher, module tiles, KPI cards, rollup tables), `projects.html` (nav,
  workspace tree, toolbar Add/▾/search/list-grid toggle, project rows & cards,
  workspace context chip), `admin.html` (nav). `theme.js` sun/moon toggle now
  inline SVG. Module pages (risk-register, drawing-register, project-schedule,
  _template) nav + tabs de-emojified and load `icons.js`.
- `dashboard.css`: icon alignment/theming block (`.pd-ico`, `.pd-navico`,
  module-tile glyph = brand red, tree/KPI/toolbar glyph alignment).
- Net effect: cleaner, enterprise-grade look appropriate for a construction firm;
  no functional changes. Auth-page `←`/`✓` kept (typographic, not playful).

### 2026-06-30 — Prompt 19: Program/Workspace rollups + Flores Group
- **Program & Workspace tabs now show real portfolio rollups** (no longer scaffold).
  Program tab = nearest Program ancestor (falls back to the Group Head node when a
  branch has no Program); Workspace tab = the project's workspace branch (node +
  descendants). Each shows KPI cards (Projects / Active / Original Budget /
  Estimated Cost / Budget Variance) and a project table (status, forecast dates,
  original vs estimated cost + variance). Rows are clickable to switch the active
  project. New tree helpers in `dashboard.html` (descendantIds, ancestorOfType,
  projectsInSubtree).
- **Added Group Head "Flores Group"** under Operations. Folded into the main
  migration seed + `supabase-setup.sql` + `supabase-schema.sql`; standalone
  `migrations/2026-06-30-add-flores-group.sql` for the live DB. **Run it (or
  re-run the workspaces migration) in Supabase.**

### 2026-06-30 — Prompt 18: Project Selector + Workspace hierarchy (Primavera-style)
- **New entry flow:** login now lands on **`projects.html`** (a Project Selector),
  not the module grid. You pick a project, then enter its **Project Home**.
- **Workspace → Program → Project hierarchy** (mirrors Oracle Primavera Cloud):
  new `workspaces` table (self-referencing tree; `node_type` workspace/program/
  group; `group_head` on group nodes = the assignment basis). Seeded the Megawide
  tree (Corporate Root → Production → Megawide EPC → Operations → Calimag/Rodrin/
  Ronquillo/Tan Groups, + PMO program, HoldCo, Bids).
- **`projects.html`:** left **workspace tree** (filter by node, counts) + right
  **projects list** grouped by workspace (Name/ID/Status/Group Head/forecast dates/
  budget) with **card/list toggle**, project search, workspace-scope context chip.
  **Add Project** and **Add Workspace/Program** (admin + planner) via modals.
  Selecting a project sets `pd_project`/`pd_project_name`/`pd_workspace` → Project Home.
- **`dashboard.html` → Project Home:** requires a selected project (else bounces to
  selector); topbar **project switcher** (jump between projects / back to selector);
  **Primavera-style tab bar Project | Program | Workspace** — module grid lives under
  **Project**, Program/Workspace are scaffold landing areas showing group-head + scope.
- **DB:** `projects` gains `workspace_id, group_head, description, project_manager,
  forecast_start, forecast_finish, original_budget, estimated_cost`. New `is_planner()`
  helper (SECURITY DEFINER). **Projects write policy widened to admins + planners**
  (`projects_write`); `workspaces` RLS (read = approved, write = planner+).
  Migration `migrations/2026-06-30-workspaces-project-selector.sql` (folded into
  `supabase-setup.sql` + `supabase-schema.sql`). **User must run this migration.**
- `db.js`: `PDb.getWorkspaces/createWorkspace/updateWorkspace`. Login redirects in
  `index.html` + `auth.js` fallback now point to `projects.html`.

### 2026-06-30 — Team restructure + priority modules
- **New developer assignments (priority phase):**
  - Cash Flow → **Georgette Dela Cruz** (gvymd)
  - Contracts, PMI & Claims Register → **Rachelle Ann Lungsod** (rachellelungsod)
  - Project Schedule & Cost Loading → **Loz Lozano** (fmlozano-pmo / PMODepartment)
- Georgette reassigned from `issues-lessons` to `cash-flow`; `issues-lessons` now unassigned.
- ONBOARDING.md tracker updated; priority modules marked.
- Development sequence: Cash Flow, Contracts & Claims, and Project Schedule are
  built first before resuming other modules.

---

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 1: Foundation scaffold
- Initial project structure, shared shell, and developer contract.
- Added: `index.html` (login), `register.html`, `pending.html`, `dashboard.html`
  (module launcher driven by `APP_CONFIG.MODULES`).
- Added shared JS: `config.js`, `auth.js` (AppAuth), `db.js` (PDb + Fmt),
  `ui.js` (UI). Added global `dashboard.css` with design tokens.
- Added `supabase-schema.sql`: `projects`, `users`, starter table per Phase-1
  module, `is_admin()/is_approved()` helpers, and RLS policies (read-all-approved,
  write-own-or-admin) applied to every module table.
- Added `MODULE_CONTRACT.md` (folder layout, required boilerplate, shared APIs,
  DB rules, git branch-per-module + PR workflow, definition of done).
- Added `modules/_template/` (full working CRUD example) and placeholder
  `index.html` + `CLAUDE.md` for all 7 module folders.
- Added `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 2: Admin screen + multi-dev git workflow
- Added `admin.html`: Users tab (approve/reject, inline role change with
  super_admin guard, per-user project assignment modal) + Projects tab
  (create/edit/archive via modal). Admin-gated by `AppAuth.requireAdmin`.
- Multi-developer collaboration handling:
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — per-developer git author identity, branch-per-module,
    rebase-before-PR, PR-into-main workflow. Recommends individual GitHub
    collaborator accounts over a shared login.
  - `.github/CODEOWNERS` — shared files → app owner, module folders → dev
    (placeholders to fill once devs assigned).
  - `.github/pull_request_template.md` — contract checklist.
  - `ONBOARDING.md` — copy/paste per-developer message + assignment tracker.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 3: Supabase wiring + Risk Register reference module
- Supabase project connected: URL `https://bgupuqnkqhixpuctyder.supabase.co`
  set in `config.js`. **anon key still pending** (user to paste; service_role
  key they shared was flagged for rotation — must NEVER be in client code).
- Schema already run by user in Supabase SQL editor. GitHub Pages enabled
  (deploy from `main`).
- Built **Risk Register** as the end-to-end reference module
  (`modules/risk-register/`): list view with filters + KPIs, 5×5 risk matrix,
  add/edit modal with app-computed `rating = likelihood × impact`, delete.
  Demonstrates every contract pattern (auth, pd_project, created_by, Fmt.esc).
- Flipped `risk-register` to `enabled: true` in `config.js`.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 4: Per-project RLS + Drawing Register reference module
- **anon key** pasted into `config.js` (verified role=anon). App can now reach DB.
- **Per-project access enforced at the DB level:** added `can_access_project()`
  helper; rewrote `projects` + all module-table RLS so admins see everything and
  planner/user/viewer only see projects in their `users.projects` array.
  Migration: `migrations/2026-06-18-project-access-rls.sql` (also folded into
  `supabase-schema.sql`). **User must run this migration in Supabase.**
- Built **Drawing Register** (`modules/drawing-register/`) as the file-upload
  reference module: status/discipline/search filters, revision + status pills,
  add/edit modal with file upload to a **private** Storage bucket, view via
  short-lived signed URL, delete (removes object + row). Enabled in `config.js`.
- Storage setup migration `migrations/2026-06-18-storage-buckets.sql` creates
  private buckets (`drawing-register`, `progress-photos`, `material-submittal`)
  + policies. **User must run this migration too.**

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 5: Live verification
- GitHub Pages live at `https://pmodepartment.github.io/planning-app/`; login
  page + deployed `config.js` (correct URL + anon key) confirmed serving.
- **Bug found via live REST probe:** all tables returned `42501 permission
  denied` for `anon`/`authenticated` — table GRANTs were missing (separate layer
  from RLS). Fix: `migrations/2026-06-18-grants.sql` (grant DML to authenticated
  + default privileges for future module tables); folded into `supabase-schema.sql`.
  **User must run this migration.**

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 6: Fix index↔dashboard redirect loop
- Verified data layer live: authed REST queries now return 200 (grants fix
  confirmed), RLS returns [] for unapproved users, anon blocked.
- **Bug:** infinite redirect loop index.html ↔ dashboard.html for users whose
  `auth.users` account has no `users` profile row (the promote UPDATE matched 0
  rows because the row never existed). `requireLogin` sent profile-less sessions
  back to index.html, which bounces sessions to dashboard → loop.
- **Fix (auth.js):** added `ensureProfile()` self-heal — a sessioned user with
  no profile row gets a `pending` row created, then goes to pending.html (never
  back to index.html). Hard stop signs out if profile truly can't be created.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 7: Brand alignment (Brandbook 2026)
- Adapted `assets/css/dashboard.css` design tokens to the Megawide Brandbook:
  Red `#EE3124`, Dark Red `#C42127`, Dark Gray `#2B2C2B` (dark surfaces), Black
  `#231F20` (text), Construction Gray `#DCDBDB` (lines), bg `#F4F4F4`.
- Typeface: Gotham (primary, licensed/not bundled) → **Montserrat** web fallback
  via Google Fonts `@import` (same convention as the Procurement WPM app). New
  `--pd-font` token; body + headings use it.
- Sidebar/topbar-dark and toast now use brand Dark Gray; brand wordmark heavier
  (800). Status colors kept distinct from brand red so errors ≠ brand.
- Single source of truth: all pages/modules inherit branding from dashboard.css;
  no per-page changes needed. If a Gotham webfont license is obtained, self-host
  it and it's picked up automatically (first in the font stack).

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 9: Logo + favicon across all pages
- Added brand assets in `assets/img/`: `favicon.png` (red Megawide "M" block
  icon), `logo-white.png` (white wordmark, cropped to content), `icon.png`
  (apple-touch). Mirrors the Procurement WPM convention.
- Favicon + apple-touch link injected into every page's `<head>` (root + all
  module pages, with correct `../../` prefix).
- Sidebar `.pd-brand` now leads with the white wordmark (`.pd-brand-logo`) and
  shows the page label as a caption; auth pages show the red mark
  (`.pd-auth-mark`). CSS added to `dashboard.css`.
- `MODULE_CONTRACT.md` boilerplate updated so new modules include favicon + logo.
  Reference modules + `_template` already updated, so future modules inherit it.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 10: Dashboard UX polish (PowerApps-inspired)
- Topbar: title "Modules" → **"Project Management Portal"** with the red
  Megawide "M" mark (`.pd-topbar-mark`) beside it; user-bar pushed right.
- **Collapsible sidebar:** `UI.initShell()` (ui.js) auto-injects a hamburger
  toggle into the topbar of every shell page; desktop collapses sidebar to zero
  width (persisted in localStorage `pd_sidebar_collapsed`), mobile slides it in.
- Logo sizing optimized (sidebar wordmark 150px; topbar mark 30px).
- **Module cards redesigned** for the big white space: fixed 4-col grid
  (→3/2/1 responsive) so 7 cards distribute as 4+3; larger tiles with
  red-tinted icon squares, brand-red hover accent strip, clearer CTA/badge.
- Added welcome header ("Welcome, <first name>") above the grid.
- New tokens `--pd-red-light` / `--pd-red-mid`.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 11: Dark mode (shared, automatic)
- Followed the Procurement app pattern: token remap on `html.pd-dark`, applied
  before paint to avoid FOUC, persisted in localStorage `pd_theme`, with
  `color-scheme: dark` for native controls.
- New `assets/js/theme.js` (loaded in every page's `<head>`): applies saved/
  system theme immediately + auto-injects a 🌙/☀️ toggle into the top bar
  (shell pages) or as a floating round button (auth pages). Zero work for devs.
- `dashboard.css`: converted hard-coded `#fff`/`#fafbfc`/`#fbfbfb` component
  backgrounds to tokens so they adapt; added the `html.pd-dark` override block
  (bg #1C1C1C, card #2B2C2B, sidebar #161717, light text/borders) + toggle btn
  styles.
- `MODULE_CONTRACT.md`: boilerplate now includes `theme.js`; added a "dark mode
  is automatic — use tokens, never hard-code #fff/#000" rule. Reference modules
  + `_template` already wired via injection, so new modules inherit dark mode.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 12: Sidebar default-collapsed, PRC-style logo, profile menu, split name, forgot-password
- Sidebar now **collapsed by default** on entry (clean look); only an explicit
  expand (localStorage `pd_sidebar_collapsed='0'`) keeps it open.
- Sidebar brand restyled to match PRC-App: white wordmark fills width
  (left-aligned), red uppercase app label, divider beneath.
- **Profile avatar menu** (PRC-style): `UI.renderUserBar` now renders a round
  initials avatar; click → dropdown with name, role, and **Sign out**. Outside-
  click closes. Token-based (dark-mode ready).
- `register.html`: Full name split into **First name / Last name** (joined into
  `users.name`).
- New **forgot-password.html** (shared styles + theme.js) using
  `resetPasswordForEmail` with a redirect back to `index.html`; linked from the
  login page ("Forgot password?").

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 13: Add 4 Phase-2 modules to the dashboard
- Registered 4 new modules in `config.js` (enabled:false → "In development"
  cards): `project-schedule` (Project Schedule, Cost Loading & S-Curve),
  `resource-loading`, `productivity-rates`, `cash-flow`.
- Created each module folder with a branded placeholder `index.html` +
  onboarding `CLAUDE.md` (same pattern as Phase-1 placeholders).
- Added starter tables to `supabase-schema.sql` + the RLS array; new migration
  `migrations/2026-06-18-phase2-modules.sql` (tables + grants + per-project RLS).
  **User must run this migration in Supabase.**
- Updated ONBOARDING.md assignment tracker.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 14: Handover readiness kit
- **`supabase-setup.sql`** — one-paste consolidated setup (all tables, grants,
  helpers, RLS, storage buckets, **demo project `DEMO01` + sample risk/drawing
  rows**, bootstrap admin). Supersedes running individual migrations.
- **`SETUP.md`** — owner checklist: config keys, run the SQL, **Supabase Auth
  settings** (email confirmation OFF, password-reset redirect URLs), bootstrap,
  GitHub Pages/branch-protection/CODEOWNERS, per-dev onboarding (self-register +
  approve + assign DEMO01), troubleshooting (42501 grants, login loop).
- **`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`** — PR review checklist against the contract.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` §1b** — run-locally runbook (static server, DEMO01 login).
- Updated README, ONBOARDING (DEMO01 access flow).
- Decision: developers get access via **self-register + owner approval**.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 17: Admin "delete user completely"
- New SECURITY DEFINER function `admin_delete_user(uuid)` — deletes `auth.users`
  (cascades to `public.users`), **freeing the email so the person can Request
  Access again**. Nulls their `created_by` authorship first (data kept) so FKs
  don't block. Admin-only; no self-delete; only super_admin deletes super_admin.
  Migration `2026-06-18-admin-delete-user.sql`; folded into setup + schema.
  **User must run this migration.**
- `PDb.deleteUser(id)` → calls the RPC; `admin.html` red **Delete** button per
  user (hidden on own row) with a confirm modal; shared `.pd-btn-danger` style.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 16: Split S-Curve into its own module + KPI contrast fix
- Renamed `project-schedule` to **"Project Schedule & Cost Loading"**; added a
  separate **`s-curve`** module (📈) with folder, placeholder, onboarding CLAUDE.md.
- New `s_curve` table (period, planned/actual value + cumulative, % planned/
  actual) in `supabase-schema.sql` + `supabase-setup.sql` + RLS arrays; migration
  `migrations/2026-06-18-s-curve-module.sql`. **User must run it on the live DB.**
- ONBOARDING tracker updated (now 13 modules total).
- Fixed Risk Register KPI card contrast (High/Medium were unreadable): scoped
  rating-band backgrounds to pills + matrix cells only; KPI cards keep the card
  surface with a token-colored number.

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 16: Split S-Curve into its own module
- `project-schedule` renamed to **"Project Schedule & Cost Loading"**; new
  **`s-curve`** module ("S-Curve", 📈) added to `config.js`.
- New `modules/s-curve/` folder (placeholder + onboarding CLAUDE.md); refreshed
  `project-schedule` placeholder for the new name.
- DB: new `s_curve` table (period, planned/actual + cumulative, % planned/actual)
  in `supabase-schema.sql` + `supabase-setup.sql` + RLS arrays; migration
  `migrations/2026-06-18-s-curve-module.sql`. **User must run this migration.**
- ONBOARDING tracker updated (project-schedule renamed + s-curve row).

### 2026-06-18 — Prompt 15: Verify setup + fix RLS recursion (54001)
- Verified live: pages serve latest (forgot-password, theme.js, phase2 config);
  Phase-2 tables exist + grants OK (200 []).
- **Bug found:** `projects`/`risk_register`/`drawing_register` returned
  `500 — 54001 stack depth limit exceeded` (RLS infinite recursion via helper
  functions querying `users`, whose own policy calls them back). Surfaced only
  now because those tables have rows (DEMO01 seed); empty tables didn't trip it.
- **Fix:** helper functions `is_admin()/is_approved()/can_access_project()` now
  `SECURITY DEFINER set search_path = public` (bypass `users` RLS → no recursion).
  Migration `2026-06-18-fix-rls-recursion.sql`; folded into both
  `supabase-setup.sql` and `supabase-schema.sql`. SETUP.md troubleshooting noted.
  **User must run the fix migration on the live DB.**

- **Still TODO (handover):** run `2026-06-18-fix-rls-recursion.sql` (or re-run
  the helper-function block of supabase-setup.sql) on the live DB; run
  `supabase-setup.sql` (adds DEMO01 + phase2
  tables); set Auth email-confirmation OFF + reset redirect URL; add devs as
  collaborators + fill CODEOWNERS usernames; send ONBOARDING messages.
  buckets via the migration; branch protection on `main`; live end-to-end test;
  remaining modules (issues-lessons, contracts-claims, stakeholder-map,
  material-submittal, progress-photos) — or hand to developers.
